*Picrochole* is a game engine aiming to (roughly) simulate warfare at the operational level. It is heavily inspired by the board game [*Le Vol de l'Aigle*](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/21915/le-vol-de-laigle/).

The name "Picrochole" comes from Rabelais' *Gargantua*: Picrochole is a warmongering king, soundly defeated by Gargantua and his friends.
